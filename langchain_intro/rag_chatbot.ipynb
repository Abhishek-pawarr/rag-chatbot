    "# Building RAG Chatbots with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll work on building an AI chatbot from start-to-finish. We will be using LangChain, OpenAI, and Pinecone vector DB, to build a chatbot capable of learning from the external world using **R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a dataset sourced from the Llama 2 ArXiv paper and other related papers to help our chatbot answer questions about the latest and greatest in the world of GenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the example we'll have a functioning chatbot and RAG pipeline that can hold a conversation and provide informative responses based on a knowledge base.\n",

    "### Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to get an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and [Pinecone API key](https://app.pinecone.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start building our chatbot, we need to install some Python libraries. Here's a brief overview of what each library does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **langchain**: This is a library for GenAI. We'll use it to chain together different language models and components for our chatbot.\n",
    "- **openai**: This is the official OpenAI Python client. We'll use it to interact with the OpenAI API and generate responses for our chatbot.\n",
    "- **datasets**: This library provides a vast array of datasets for machine learning. We'll use it to load our knowledge base for the chatbot.\n",
    "- **pinecone-client**: This is the official Pinecone Python client. We'll use it to interact with the Pinecone API and store our chatbot's knowledge base in a vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install these libraries using pip like so:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
